# Installation
Just go to [Releases](https://github.com/tilda/GoodWhatever/releases) and download the rmskin.

# Configuration
All configuration is in the .ini file. I'm not about to make a whole config GUI for something *this* simple :P

Every option is commented to make it easier for you, just in case.
